# Assignment 5
### Geometrical transformations.

1. The program **t5p1.cpp** displays some 3D objects (a cube, a sphere) using GLUT functions and also some 3D geometrical transformations.\
Recognize the OpenGL functions that achieve these geometrical transformations.


2. Write a program (according to the course example) that, by using successive 3D geometrical transformations (translations and rotations), puts an arbitrary (i.e., which does not lie in one of the planes Oxy, Oxz, Oyz) triangle in the Oyz plane (having one of its edges on the Oz axis).\
Use only the primary rotations (w.r.t. the Ox, Oy, and Oz axes).


3. Given a cube having the side 1, a vertex on (0,0,0) and the opposite vertex on (1,1,1), which are the necessary transformations for rotating it by **N** degrees w.r.t. the main diagonal (starting in (0,0,0) and ending in (1,1,1)) counterclockwise and looking along the diagonal through the origin? The transformations should rotate the cube as in the example **t5p3.exe**.\
Use only the primary rotations (w.r.t. the Ox, Oy, and Oz axes).
